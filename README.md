Tektronix Waveform File Format Reader Class


Tektornix oscilloscopes use WFM ( waveform ) file format to save waveform data.

This simple class was created to be able to parse and split WFM files that were captured using FastFrame (https://www.tek.com/en/documents/technical-brief/using-fastframe-segmented-memory-4-5-6-series-mso).
